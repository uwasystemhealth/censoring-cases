The 4993 circuit packs from Vendor 1 came straight from production. 4993 circuit packs from Vendor 2 had already seen 1000 hours of burn-in testing at the maufacturing plant under operating condition similar to those in the field trial. Such circuit packs were sold at a higher price because field reliability was supposed to have been improved by the burn-in screening of circuit packs containing defective components.

They would conduct inspections of all the packs periodically, they would then know if a circuit pack broke since their last inspection (but they don't know exactly when during that time). `event` tells us the kind of event this is, it can take on 3 categories: `Left`, `Interval` and `Suspended`. \"Left\" corresponds to the packs which were removed during Vendor 1's burn-in phase, \"Suspended\" corresponds to packs that remained running at the end of the experiment, \"Interval\" corresponds to packs which failed during an interval of time \\[hoursl, hoursu\\]. `vendor` states which vendor manufactured the circuit pack."

An initial glance at this plot may make you believe that failures occur earlier in the lifetime of the deisel generator fans (indicating the existence of \"burn-in\" failures) however, also notice that there are more suspensions at earlier times than later times too, which indicates there are lots of deisel generator fans surviving at the start of the test. We will have to perform more analysis to form a conclusion."

    "Nuclear power plants use heat exchangers to transfer energy from the reactor to steam turbines. A typical heat exchanger contains thousands of tubes through which steam flows continuously when the heat exchanger is in service. With age, heat exchanger tubes develop cracks, usually due to some combination of stress-corrosion and fatigue. A heat exchanger can continue to operate safely when the cracks are small. If cracks get large enough, however, leaks can develop, and these could lead to serious safety problems and expensive, unplanned plant shut-down time. To protect against least, heat exchangers are taken out of serviec periodically so that its tubes (and other components) can be inspected with nondestructive evaluation techniques. At the end of each inspection period, tubes with detected cracks are plugged so that water will no longer pass through them. This reduces plant efficiency but extends the life of the expensive heat exchangers. With this in mid, heat exchangers are built with extra capacity and can remmain in operation up until the point where a certain percentage (e.g., 5%) of the tubes have been plugged.  "
