## Description
This project consists of various censored-data analysis case studies in Python.
The datasets used come from Reliability and Risk Analysis (Modarres, Kaminskiy & Krivtsov, 2016).

## Usage/Installation
1. Download the project: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository
2. Download & Install Jupyter: https://jupyter.org/install
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook(s) titled `FailureTimeNoExplanatory.ipynb` or `FailureTimeWithExplanatory.ipynb`

## Notebooks
There are currently 2 different notebooks in this project:
1. **FailureTimeNoExplanatory**
  - Example 1: Integrated Circuit Life Test Data
  - Example 2: Circuit Pack Reliability Field Trial
  - Example 3: Diesel Generator Fan Failure Data
  - Example 4: Heat Exchanger Tube Crack Data
  - Example 5: Transmitter Vacuum Tube Data
  - Example 6: Turbine Wheel Crack Initiation Data

2. **FailureTimeWithExplanatory**
  - Example 1: Printed Circuit Board Accelerated Life Test Data
  - Example 2: Accelerated Test of Spacecraft Nickel-Cadmium Batttery Cells

## Authors and acknowledgment
All analysis has been originally completed by Michael Nefiodovas in 2022. Analysis steps and procedures inspired by Reliability engineering and risk analysis (Modarres, Kaminskiy & Krivtsov, 2016). All developments were funded by Melinda Hodkiewicz's BHP Fellowship.
